# Capstone Project: The Analysis of Child Nutrition Status: For the Case of Uzbekistan


## Overview
This repository contains all the code and data for my capstone project on predicting stunting in children under five years of age using machine learning. The project aims to identify the most significant predictors of stunting and to develop a predictive model that can be used to inform interventions.

## Repository Structure
- `Merging_Recodes.Rmd`: R Markdown file that merges three recodes (women, children, and birth history) into one comprehensive dataset.
- `Descriptive_Statistics.py`: Python script for calculating descriptive statistics of the dataset.
- `Bivariate_Analysis.py`: Python script for performing bivariate analysis between stunting and other categorical variables.
- `Preprocessing_Data.py`: Python script for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- `Machine_Learning_Algorithms.py`: Python script containing the machine learning models used to predict stunting.
- `data.csv`: Initial dataset.
- `processed_data.csv`: Cleaned and preprocessed dataset produced by `Preprocessing_Data.py`.
- `desc_stats.csv`: Output file containing descriptive statistics, generated by `Descriptive_Statistics.py`.
- `bivariate_analysis.csv`: Output file containing results of the bivariate analysis, generated by `Bivariate_Analysis.py`.
- `final_report.pdf`: Comprehensive report of the project findings and methodology.

## How to Run the Files
To reproduce the analysis and results of this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Python libraries required include pandas, sklearn, imblearn, and numpy.

### Instructions
1. **Run Python Scripts**:
   - Ensure your Python environment is set up with necessary libraries.
   - Run `Descriptive_Statistics.py` to generate `desc_stats.csv`.
   - Run `Bivariate_Analysis.py` to perform bivariate analysis and create `bivariate_analysis.csv`.
   - Run `Preprocessing_Data.py` to preprocess the data and produce `processed_data.csv`.
   - Finally, run `Machine_Learning_Algorithms.py` to apply machine learning models and analyze the results.

2. **Review the Final Report**:
   - Open and review `final_report.pdf` to understand the findings and conclusions of the project.
